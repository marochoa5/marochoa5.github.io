<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired from?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Haati Chai</li>
</ul>
<h1>How do they distribute effective use of space, size, or balance?</h1>
<p> Although different styles, both sites exhibit effective use of space, size, and balance. Google uses the negative space to draw attention to the positive which is the logo. While Haati Chai (jewlery line) utilized the negative space for pictorials displaying the variety of merchandise they have to offer. Pictures are constantly changing every 5 seconds or so which makes it the primary focal point in the site.</p>
<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
<p>While both sites display a positive "call to action" the Hierarchy is a bit different in both websites. Google's flow is straight to the logo with no negative space, meanwhile Haati Chai's flow is focused on the negative space displaying the different varieties of merchandise you can purchase.</p>
